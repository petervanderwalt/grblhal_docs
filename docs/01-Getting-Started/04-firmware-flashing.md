# Firmware Flashing

This guide will walk you through the process of getting grblHAL firmware onto your controller board. There are two main approaches: using the **Web Builder** (recommended for most users) or **manual compilation** (for advanced users).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **A compatible controller board** (see [Hardware Selection](./03-controller-support.md))
2. **A USB cable** to connect your board to your computer
3. **Basic knowledge** of your controller board model
4. **Drivers installed** for your board (if required by your OS)

:::tip Backup Your Settings
If you're updating existing grblHAL firmware, **always backup your settings** first using `$$` command and saving the output. Some firmware updates may reset settings to defaults.

## Verification

After flashing, verify your installation:

1. **Connect via USB** to your computer
2. **Open a serial terminal** (115200 baud, 8N1)
   - Use Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, PuTTY, or your G-code sender
3. **Send `$I` command**
   - You should see grblHAL version info and board name
4. **Send `$$` command**
   - You should see all settings

**Example response:**
```
[VER:2.1.3-beta.20250101:grblHAL driver for STM32F4xx]
[OPT:VL,15,128]
[NEWOPT:ENUMS,RT+,SED,TC,ETH]
[FIRMWARE:grblHAL]
[BOARD:Flexi-HAL]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Board Not Recognized

- **Check USB cable** (must be data cable, not charge-only)
- **Install drivers** (CH340, CP2102, or board-specific drivers)
- **Try different USB port**
- **Check Device Manager** (Windows) or `lsusb` (Linux) to see if device appears

### Flashing Fails

- **Verify correct driver/board selection** in Web Builder
- **Check DFU/bootloader mode** is properly entered
- **Try lower baud rate** for ESP32 (460800 instead of 921600)
- **Check start address** for STM32 (0x08000000 vs 0x08008000)
- **Disable antivirus** temporarily (can interfere with flashing tools)

### Board Boots but No Response

- **Check baud rate** (should be 115200)
- **Try different terminal program**
- **Send `Ctrl+X` (soft reset)** to wake up grblHAL
- **Check for correct COM port**

### Settings Reset After Update

- This is normal for major version updates
- **Restore from backup** using `$<setting>=<value>` commands
- Or reconfigure manually using `$$` as reference

## Next Steps

Once firmware is successfully flashed:

1. **Configure your machine** - Set steps/mm, max rates, acceleration
2. **Test basic motion** - See [First Connection & Motion](./05-first-connection.md)
3. **Calibrate your machine** - Jump to [Machine Calibration](../03-Machine-Calibration/01-introduction.md)
