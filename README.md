# grblHAL Documentation

[![Build and publish documentation](https://github.com/grblHAL/grblhal_docs/actions/workflows/publish-docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grblHAL/grblhal_docs/actions/workflows/publish-docs.yml)

Live documentation: [grblhal.org/docs](https://grblhal.org/docs)

This repository contains the Markdown source for the grblHAL documentation site.

## Edit documentation

Edit Markdown files in `content/markdown/` with any text editor, then commit and open a pull request. Images and other site assets belong in `content/images/`.

File and folder names are ordered by their numeric prefix:

```text
01-Getting-Started/
  01-what-is-grblhal.md
  02-grbl-vs-grblhal.md
```

The page index automatically includes `##` headings. To include a specific `###` heading as well, add a hidden marker at the end of the heading:

```md
### Advanced configuration <!-- toc -->
```

The marker is an HTML comment, so it is ignored by standard Markdown renderers.

## Build and publish

The GitHub Actions workflow builds the HTML site from committed Markdown and publishes it to [grblhal.org/docs](https://grblhal.org/docs) whenever a change is merged into `main`.

The generated `docs/` folder is a build artifact and is intentionally not committed. To generate it locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

The build preserves the existing navigation, search, Markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, wiki links, admonitions, table of contents, and responsive styling. Do not edit `docs/` directly.
