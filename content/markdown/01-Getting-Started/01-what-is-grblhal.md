# What is grblHAL?

**grblHAL** is a sophisticated, high-performance CNC (Computer Numerical Control) firmware designed to control CNC machines, routers, mills, lathes, laser cutters, and other motion control systems. It represents a complete evolution of the popular open-source [GRBL firmware](https://github.com/gnea/grbl), specifically engineered to leverage the power of modern 32-bit microcontrollers.

## Overview

grblHAL interprets G-code commands (the standard programming language for CNC machines) and translates them into precise motion control signals that drive your machine's motors, spindle, and other peripherals. Think of it as the "brain" of your CNC machine - it takes instructions from your CAM software and executes them with precision and reliability.

grblHAL was created to address the limitations of 8-bit GRBL implementations and the fragmentation that occurred when various developers attempted to port GRBL to 32-bit platforms independently.

## Core Architecture: The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The defining feature of grblHAL is its **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** architecture. This design separates the core GRBL logic from processor-specific code, making the firmware:

- **Highly portable** across different microcontroller platforms
- **Easier to maintain** with consistent bug fixes and features across all supported boards
- **Future-proof** as new hardware platforms can be added without rewriting core functionality

This means whether you're running grblHAL on an ESP32, STM32, Teensy 4.1, or Raspberry Pi Pico, you get the same core functionality and feature set.

## Key Features

### **High Performance**
- **Step rates exceeding 300 kHz** (some implementations reach 400-600 kHz)
- Supports clock speeds from 40 MHz up to 600 MHz
- Jitter-free, stable control pulses for smooth motion
- Significantly faster than 8-bit GRBL (~30 kHz maximum)

### **Advanced Motion Control**
- **Up to 8-axis control** for complex machines with compile time selectable axis letters for axes 3 - 7
- Auto-squaring for dual-motor gantry systems
- Backlash compensation
- High-precision spindle synchronization (for threading operations)

### **Extended G-code Support**
- Comprehensive G-code compatibility aligned with **LinuxCNC standards**
- Canned cycles (drilling, pocketing, etc.)
- Full set of coordinate system offsets (G54-G59.3)
- Tool change support (M6)
- Parameter programming and expressions
- Optional parameters for advanced operations

### **Connectivity Options**
- **Wi-Fi** (on supported controllers)
- **Ethernet** (on supported controllers)
- **Bluetooth** (on supported controllers)
- Traditional USB serial connection via UART <> USB converter chip
- 'Native' USB CDC serial connection via MCU USB peripherhal (on supported controllers, speed limited by the USB stack - not the baud rate)
- [WebUI](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_WebUI/) for browser-based control (on supported controllers with WiFi or Ethernet connectivity)

### **Plugin Architecture**
- Open, extensible [plugin system](https://github.com/grblHAL/plugins)
- Add custom M-codes, system commands and functionality
- [Third-party driver](https://github.com/grblHAL/3rd_party_drivers) support
- User-defined event handlers
- Examples: SD card support, automatic tool changers, custom I/O control

### **Rich Feature Set**
- [SD card](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card/) support for standalone operation
- Multiple work coordinate systems
- Probing cycles for tool measurement and workpiece setup
- Laser mode with dynamic power control
- Lathe mode with support for G7/G8 and G96. Spindle synced motion on supported controllers
- Safety features: E-Stop, Safety Door, Reset
- Real-time override controls (feed rate, spindle speed, rapid rate)

## Who Should Use grblHAL?

grblHAL is ideal for:

- **Hobbyists** building or upgrading CNC routers, mills, or laser cutters
- **Makers** who want professional-grade features at low cost
- **Small businesses** needing reliable, feature-rich CNC control
- **Developers** wanting to extend or customize CNC firmware
- **Anyone upgrading** from 8-bit GRBL seeking better performance

## What You'll Need

To use grblHAL, you'll need:

1. **A compatible controller board** (see [Hardware Selection](./03-controller-support.md))
2. **A CNC machine** (router, mill, lathe, laser cutter, etc.)
3. **A G-code sender application** (such as ioSender, gSender, or bCNC)
4. **CAM software** to generate G-code from your designs

## Cost-Effective Professional Features

Despite offering features typically found in expensive industrial controllers, grblHAL remains a **low-cost solution** thanks to the affordability of modern 32-bit microcontrollers. You get professional-grade performance without the professional-grade price tag.

## Open Source & Community Driven

grblHAL is **open-source software**, meaning:

- Free to use and modify
- Active community support
- Regular updates and improvements
- Transparent development process
- Extensive documentation and examples
