## SD-Card (File Systems)
Github Repository: https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card

The SD card plugin repository contains a collection of plugins that offers storage and file handling that integrates with the core based [Virtual File System - VFS](/docs/reference/commands#file-handling).

### FS FatFS and FS littlefs

These plugins are integration layers for VFS that provides file access to SD cards via [FatFs](https://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/) and flash or EEPROM based files via the [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) file systems.

### FS Stream

The FS Stream plugin sits on top of VFS and provides a number of $-commands for file handling:

| Command           | Description |
|:-----------------:|-------------|
| **`$F`**          | List CNC-compatible files (`.nc`, `.gcode`, etc.) in the current working directory |
| **`$F+`**         | List all files in the current working directory regardless of extension |
| **`$F=[file]`**   | Run G-code file |
| **`$CWD=[path]`** | Change Directory |
| **`$PWD`**        | Print Working Directory |
| **`$FM`**         | Mount SD card |
| **`$FU`**         | Unmount SD card |
| **`$FD=[file]`**  | Delete file |

The commands are documented in more detail [here](/docs/reference/commands#file-system-commands).

#### Examples:
```gcode
; Mount SD card
$FM

; List files
$F+

; Run a file
$F=myprogram.ngc

; Change directory
$CWD=subdir

; Print working directory
$PWD
```

### Macro

The macro plugin takes care of file handling for the `G65`, `G66` and `M98` subroutine commands and mapping of the tool change commands `T`, `M6` and `M60` to file based macros.

| Command          | Maps to |
|:----------------:|:--------|
|`T`               | _ts.macro_ - for selecting the tool, may be used to move a tool carousel in place (optional) |
|`M6`              | _tc.macro_ - for changing the tool |
|`M60`             | _ps.macro_ - for pallet shuttle (optional) |
|`G65, G66 and M98`| _P\<n\>.macro_ where _\<n\>_ is taken from the commands P-word|

The file used for subroutine commands is searched for in the root directory (`\`) then `\littlefs` and finally `\embedded`.  
The files used for tool change commands are searched for when a file system is mounted and then in the mount directory of that file system.
When a tool change file is found _all_ tool change files are bound to the same directory.

### YModem

The YModem plugin adds the [YModem protocol](http://wiki.synchro.net/ref:ymodem) to grblHAL and allows file down- and uploading for senders that are compatible.  
When this plugin is added to the firmware downloading is initiated by the sender by sending a `SOH` (`0x01`) or `STX` (`0x02`) character.
NOTE: this deviates from the protocol where the receiver is required to start the transfer by sending a `C` character after the sender is set up for the transfer.  
Uploading (available since build 20260916) is initiated by the `$YUP=filename` system command. The sender starts the transfer, if the command was `ok`'ed, by sending a single `C` character.

> [!NOTE]
> If the transfer fails the controller may not respond to normal input until the protocol handler times out and returns control back.
> The protocol itself is fairly robust so this should only occur following a communication loss or from a badly implemented protocol sender side.

## Networking
Github Repository: https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_networking/

This plugin contains code for network protocol support on top of the lwIP TCP/IP stack.

#### Server protocols supported:

* Telnet \("raw" mode\).
* Websocket.
* FTP \(requires [SD card plugin](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card) and card inserted\).
* HTTP \(requires [SD card plugin](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card) and card inserted\).
* WebDAV - as an extension the HTTP daemon. __Note:__ saving files does not yet work with Windows mounts. Tested ok with WinSCP.
* mDNS - \(multicast DomainName Server\).
* SSDP - \(Simple Service Discovery Protocol\). Requires the HTTP daemon running.

The mDNS and SSDP protocols uses UPD multicast/unicast transmission of data and not all drivers are set up to handle that "out-of-the-box".  
Various amount of manual code changes are needed to make them work, see the [RP2040 readme](https://github.com/grblHAL/RP2040/blob/master/README.md).

#### Client protocols supported:

* MQTT - \(MQ Telemetry Transport\). A programming API is provided for plugin code, not used by standard code.

MQTT requires lwIP 2.1.x for authentication support \(username & password\). [Template/example](https://github.com/grblHAL/Templates/tree/master/my_plugin/MQTT_example) code is available.

#### System commands {#network-commands}

$NETIF - TBC

#### Settings {#network-settings}

#### `$70` – Enable Services (mask)
The master switch for enabling or disabling network-related services (daemons).

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This is a **critical** setting for any network-enabled board. Even if you configure all the IP address and WiFi settings (`$300+`), the services **will not run** unless they are enabled here.
> - This is a **bitmask**: add together the values of the services you want to enable.


| Bit | Value | Service to Enable | Description |
|:---:|:-----:|:------------------|:------------|
| 0   | 1     | Telnet | A raw data stream used by some G-code senders. |
| 1   | 2     | FTP | Allows network file transfer to/from the SD card. |
| 2   | 4     | HTTP | The standard web server (often used with WebSockets). |
| 3   | 8     | WebSocket | A modern, efficient protocol for web-based GUIs. |
| 4   | 16    | mDNS (Bonjour) | Broadcasts the controller's name on the network (e.g., `grblHAL.local`). |
| 5   | 32    | WebDAV | An alternative to FTP for network file access. |

#### Common Examples
*   **All Services Disabled (Default):**
    *   `$70=0`
*   **Enable Common Services for a GUI:**
    *   Most modern senders use Telnet or WebSockets, and FTP is needed for file transfers. mDNS is for easy discovery.
    *   `1` (Telnet) + `2` (FTP) + `8` (WebSocket) + `16` (mDNS) → `$70=27`
*   **Enable All Services:**
    *   `1+2+4+8+16+32` → `$70=63`

> [!TIP]
> - If you have configured your network settings but still cannot connect to the controller, this is the **first setting you should check**.
> - For security and to save memory on the controller, only enable the services you actually plan to use.
> - Use `$NETIF` to see which services are running (listening) as well as the Network interface's MAC address and IP address.


### Ethernet <!-- toc -->

The ethernet plugin is driver specific since it sits between the LwIP stack and the networking plugin...

#### Settings {#ethernet-settings}


#### `$300` – Hostname
Sets the machine's name on the network.

| Value | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| String| A string of up to 32 characters, default is "grblHAL". |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This is the name your controller will announce on the network.
> - It can be used to connect via mDNS (e.g., `grblHAL.local`) if `$70` has mDNS enabled.
> - It also helps identify the device in your router's client list.

**Common Examples**
* _Default Hostname:_
  * `$300=grblHAL`
* _Custom Hostname for a specific machine:_
  * `$300=MyCNC`or `$300=Laser` (mDNS respectively mycnc.local or laser.local)

> [!TIP]
> - For maximum compatibility, use a simple name without spaces or special characters.
> - A reboot of the controller is often required for a new hostname to be broadcast on the network.

---

#### `$301` – Ethernet IP Mode
Selects the method the controller uses to obtain an IP address for the connection.

| Value | Meaning | Description |
|:-----:|:--------|:------------|
| 0     | Static | You must manually set the IP (`$302`), Gateway (`$303`), and Netmask (`$304`). |
| 1     | DHCP   | The controller asks your router for an IP address. (Recommended) |
| 2     | AutoIP | A fallback where the controller picks a random address if DHCP fails. |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - **Static** is useful if the controlling computer has a dedicated ethernet port for the controller. A dedicated network interface for the controller is preferred - no collisions or competition for bandwidth, or for networks where DHCP is not available.
> - **DHCP** is the standard for most networks, where your router automatically assigns an address.

**Common Examples**
* _Home/Office Network with a Router:_
  * This is the easiest option.  
    `$301=1`
* _Direct Connection to a PC (no router):_
    * You must assign a permanent, non-conflicting address.  
    `$301=0`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you select Static mode, you are responsible for providing correct and non-conflicting network information.
> Reserve the address in the router if possible.

---

#### `$302` – Ethernet IP Address
Manually sets the static IP address for the controller.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| String| The IP address in dot-decimal notation, default is normally "192.168.1.5" |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This setting is **only** used if `$301=0` (Static IP Mode).
> - The IP address must be unique on your network.

**Common Examples**
* _Typical Static IP on a Home Network:_
  * Make sure this address is outside your router's DHCP assignment range or is reserved for static assignment.  
  `$302=192.168.1.200`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you set an IP that is already in use by another device, you will have an "IP conflict" and neither device may work correctly.
> - The IP address must be in the same subnet as the Gateway and your computer (as defined by the Netmask).

---

#### `$303` – Ethernet Gateway
Manually sets the Gateway (router) IP address.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| String| Your router's IP address, e.g., "192.168.1.1". |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This setting is **only** used if `$301=0` (Static IP Mode).
> - The Gateway is the address of the device that connects your local network to the internet (usually your router).
> - It is required for features like NTP time synchronization to work.

**Common Examples**
* _Typical Home Router Address:_
  * `$303=192.168.1.1`

> [!TIP]
> If you can't connect to your controller from another network segment or if NTP fails, an incorrect Gateway address is a likely cause.

---

#### `$304` – Ethernet Netmask
Manually sets the Subnet Mask for the controller.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| String| The Subnet Mask, default is "255.255.255.0". |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This setting is **only** used if `$301=0` (Static IP Mode).
> - The Netmask defines the size of your local network.

**Common Examples**
* _Standard Home/Office Network:_
  * This value is correct for the vast majority of local networks.  
  `$304=255.255.255.0`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An incorrect Netmask can prevent the controller from communicating with other devices, even on the local network. When in doubt, use DHCP (`$301=1`).

---

#### `$305` – Telnet Port
Configures the network port for the Telnet service.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Port #| A valid TCP port number, default is 23. |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - The Telnet service provides a raw, text-based data stream to and from the grblHAL controller.
> - It is used by some G-code senders for faster and more EMI resistant communication than the serial port provides.

> [!TIP]
> - Usually there is no need to change this port unless you have a specific reason
> - You will need this port number to configure your G-code sender if it uses Telnet.

---

#### `$306` – HTTP Port
Configures the network port for the HTTP service.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Port #| A valid TCP port number, default is 80. |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - The HTTP service provides a web server running on the controller, for loading a WebUI, uploading files etc.
> - Modern web interfaces for grblHAL typically also use the WebSocket service (`$307`) for communication.

> [!TIP]
> This port is often used for to load a WebUI. For example, you might connect by typing `http://<ip>` into a browser.

---

#### `$307` – WebSocket Port
Configures the network port for the WebSocket service.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Port #| A valid TCP port number, default is 80 if the web server is not running, else 81. |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - The WebSocket service provides a fast, modern, and efficient way for web-based user interfaces to communicate with the controller.
> - This, (along with Telnet `$305`) are the key services for most modern network-based G-code senders.

> [!TIP]
> This port is often used for a WebUI as well.

---

#### `$308` – FTP Port
Configures the network port for the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) service.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Port #| A valid TCP port number, default is 21. |

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - The FTP service allows you to transfer G-code files to and from the controller's SD card over the network.
> - This is extremely convenient for sending job files to the machine without needing to physically move the SD card.


> [!TIP]
> Use a standard FTP client application (like FileZilla or WinSCP) to connect to the controller's IP address on this port.

## WebUI
Github Repository: https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_WebUI

Provides a server backend [ESP32-WEBUI](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-webui) for some networking capable boards and drivers.

This plugin sits on top of a heavily modified [lwIP](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) raw mode http daemon.  

#### Installation:

Enable WebUI support by uncommenting `#define WEBUI_ENABLE 1` in _my_machine.h_ and recompile/reflash.
This adds backends for both WebUI v2 and v3, set the define value to 2 or 3 to only add v2 or v3.

Ensure `$306` \(HTTP port\) is set to `80`, `$307` \(Websocket port\) is set to `81` and `$70` has flags set to enable both the http and websocket daemons. `15` is a safe value. Reboot.

For drivers with FlashFS support \(see table above\) enter `<ip address>/` or `<ip address>/?forcefallback=yes` as the browser URL,
the latter if it is for an update.  
Replace `<ip address>` with the controller IP address. Tip: Use `$I` to find the IP address if dynamically assigned. 
Then click on the _Interface_ top menu item in the page shown and navigate to the _dist/CNC/grblHAL_ folder and download _index.html.gz_.
You may download _index.html.gz_ directly via this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI/3.0/dist/CNC/GRBLHal/index.html.gz).
Upload the file via the upload button in the _FileSystem_ panel.

For drivers without FlashFS support download directly or from [this page](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D-WEBUI/tree/3.0/dist/CNC/GRBLHal), create a _www_ folder on the SD card and copy the download file there.
If the SD card is mounted in the controller then the folder can be created and the file copied either via ftp or WebDAV provided the protocol to be used has been activated.

Finally enter the controller IP address in a browser window, if all is well the WebUI will then be loaded.

This plugin can be complemented with an [additional plugin](#fluidnc-webui-support) that allows the [FluidNC fork](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/features/webui) of the ESP3D WebUI to run.

## Fan Control
Github Repository: https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_fans

Adds two M-codes for controlling fans, adopted from [Marlin specifications](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M106.html) \(with fewer parameter values supported\).

* `M106 <P->` turns fan on. The optional P-word specifies the fan, if not supplied fan 0 is turned on.
* `M107 <P->` turns fan off. The optional P-word specifies the fan, if not supplied fan 0 is turned off.

The new realtime command `0x8A` can also be used to toggle fan 0 on/off even when a G-code program is running.

Add a line with

`#define FANS_ENABLE <n>`

to _my_machine.h_ to enable `<n>` fans, e.g. `#define FANS_ENABLE 1` for one.

If the driver supports mapping of port number to fan the following $-settings, depending on number of fans configured, are made available:

`$386` - for mapping aux port to Fan 0.  
`$387` - for mapping aux port to Fan 1.  
`$388` - for mapping aux port to Fan 2.  
`$389` - for mapping aux port to Fan 3.

Use the `$pins` command to see which port/pin is currently assigned.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A hard reset is required after changing port to fan mappings.  

Fans can be linked to the spindle enable command, thus turning them automatically on and off depending on the spindle state.  
> [!NOTE]
> If a fan is turned on by `M106` \(or the new real time command\) before enabling the spindle it will _not_ be turned off automatically when the spindle is stopped.

`$483` - bits for linking specific fans to spindle enable.

Fan 0 can be configured be turned off automatically on program completion, or spindle disable if linked, after a configurable delay.  

`$480` - number of minutes to delay automatic turnoff of fan 0.   
> [!NOTE]
> If set to 0 fan 0 is not automatically turned off by program end and is turned off immediately if linked to spindle enable.

#### M-Codes{#fan-mcodes}

| M-Code | Syntax | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `M106` | `M106 P[fan] S[speed]` | Turn fan ON, set PWM speed (0–255) |
| `M107` | `M107 P[fan]` | Turn fan OFF |

#### $-Settings{#fan-settings}

| $-Setting | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `$386-$389` | Map aux port → fan 0..3 |
| `$480` | Auto-off delay (minutes) |
| `$483` | Bitmask: link fans to spindle enable |

#### Example
```gcode
; Turn on fan 0 at PWM 200
M106 P0 S200

; Turn off fan 0
M107 P0
```

| $357 - Void Override \(%\) | N/A    | This sets the size of the change in cut voltage necessary to lock the THC to prevent torch dive \(higher values need greater voltage change to lock THC\)|
| $682 - Z feed factor \(%\) | 1,2   | This sets the Z-axis feedrate to use for height corrections as a percentage of the actual XY feedrate.|

#### ARC

| Setting                | Modes | Description |
|------------------------|-------|-------------|

<sup>1</sup> This pin/port is required to enable voltage controlled THC.  
<sup>2</sup> This pin/port is required to enable the plugin.

Tip: use the `$PINS` command to list available pins. The port number is the number following the "_Aux in_" text, an example: `[PIN:P3.2,Aux in 0,P0]`.

#### $674 - Plugin options

| Bit | Value |Description |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 0   | 1     | Enable [virtual ports](#virtual-ports). |
| 1   | 2     | Sync Z position. Update the Z position when THC control ends. |

Add the _Value_ fields for the functionality to enable to get the one to use for the setting.

#### Virtual ports

Virtual ports are controlled by regular M-Codes.

* `M62 P2` will disable THC \(Synchronized with Motion\)

* `M63 P2` will enable THC \(Synchronized with Motion\)

* `M64 P2` will disable THC \(Immediately\)

* `M65 P2` will enable THC \(Immediately\)

* `M67 E3 Q-` Velocity Reduction \(Immediately\)

* `M68 E3 Q-` Velocity Reduction \(Synchronized with Motion)

The `Q`-word for `M67` and `M68` is the percentage of the programmed feed rate the actual feed rate will be changed to.

The minimum percentage allowed is 10%, values below this will be set to 10%.  
The maximum percentage allowed is 100%, values above this will be set to 100%.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Virtual ports will shadow any real ports with the same port number. Some dummy ports may also be added since the core require port numbers to be consecutive starting from 0.

#### Materials

The plugin can load and partially make use of LinuxCNC and/or SheetCam style material files. Loading is from either a SD card or from root mounted littlefs file system.

The following files are currently loaded from if present:
* LinuxCNC: _/linuxcnc/material.cfg_
* SheetCam: _/sheetcam/default.tools_

Additionally materials can be modified or added by LinuxCNC style _magic_ [gcode comments](https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/plasma/qtplasmac.html#plasma:magic-comments).

To select the material to use `M190P<n>` where `<n>` is the material number.  
If NGC parameter support is enabled in the controller the feedrate from the selected material can be set by adding `F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>` to the gcode file.

Currently loaded materials can be output to the sender console with the `$EM` command, the output is in a machine readable format.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings updated via _magic_ comments are currently _not_ written back to the material file.

#### Dependencies:

Driver must support a number of auxiliary I/O ports, at least one digital input for the arc ok signal.  
Some drivers support the MCP3221 I2C ADC, when enabled it can be used for the arc voltage signal.

#### Credits:

LinuxCNC documentation linked to above.

## Sienci ATCi (Automatic Tool Changer Interface) {#sienciatc}
Github Repository: https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/grblhal-atci-plugin

This plugin provides advanced safety, state management, and sensor integration for the **[Sienci Automatic Tool Changer (ATC)](https://sienci.com/product/automatic_tool_changer/)**.

### M-Codes{#sienci-atci-mcode}

| M-Code | Syntax | Description |
|:------:|:------:|:------------|
| `M960` | `M960 P-` | Keepout enforcement control. |

| Parameter | Description |
|:---------:|:------------|
| **`P`**   | `0` - disable keepout enforcement, `1` - enable keepout enforcement. |

### $-Settings{#sienci-atci-settings}

#### `$683` – ATCi Configuration (mask)
Configures the operating modes for the Sienci Automatic Tool Changer Interface plugin.

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - This is a **bitmask**: add together the values of the options you want to enable.
> - **Rack Monitor:** Uses `AUXINPUT7` to detect if the rack is physically mounted. If the rack is removed, the Keepout zone is automatically disabled.
> - **TC Macro Monitor:** Automatically disables the Keepout zone while a Tool Change macro is running to allow tool fetching.


| Bit | Value | Option | Description |
|:---:|:-----:|:-------|:------------|
| 0   | 1     | **Enable Plugin** | Master switch to enable the Keepout Zone logic on startup. |
| 1   | 2     | **Monitor Rack Presence** | Only enforce Keepout if the rack sensor (`AUXINPUT7`) is triggered. |
| 2   | 4     | **Monitor TC Macro** | Automatically disable Keepout when a tool change macro is active. |

#### Common Examples
*   **Enable Basic Keepout:**
    *   `$683=1`
*   **Enable Full Automation (Rack Sensor + Macro Awareness):**
    *   `$683=7` (1+2+4)

#### `$684` – `$687` – ATCi Keepout Zone Boundaries
Defines the rectangular safety zone around the tool rack in machine coordinates.

> ℹ️ **Info**
> - These settings define the X and Y limits of the area where the spindle is forbidden to enter during normal operation (jogging/G-code).
> - Entering this zone is only allowed if `M810 P0` is sent, or if the "Monitor TC Macro" option is enabled and a macro is running.
> - **Note:** The plugin includes a "jog-out" feature allowing you to escape the zone if trapped, but prevents jogging deeper in.

| Setting | Description | Units |
|:--------|:------------|:------|
| `$684`  | **X Min:** Left boundary of the zone. | mm |
| `$685`  | **Y Min:** Front boundary of the zone. | mm |
| `$686`  | **X Max:** Right boundary of the zone. | mm |
| `$687`  | **Y Max:** Back boundary of the zone. | mm |

> [!TIP]
> - Move your machine to the front-left corner of your rack area and note the machine coordinates for `$684`/`$685`.
> - Move to the back-right corner and note coordinates for `$686`/`$687`.
> - Add a small buffer (e.g., 5mm) to these values to ensure safety.

#### Real-time Report
Appends `|ATCI:[flags]` to the status string.
*   **E**: Enforcement Enabled
*   **Z**: Machine is Inside Zone
*   **R/M/T/S**: Source of state (Rack, M-code, Tool Macro, Startup)
*   **I**: Rack Installed
*   **B**: Drawbar Open
*   **L**: Tool Loaded
*   **P**: Low Air Pressure

#### Example
```gcode

$684=10.0   ; X Min
$686=50.0   ; X Max
$685=10.0   ; Y Min
$687=50.0   ; Y Max
$683=7      ; Enable plugin (1) + Monitor Rack (2) + Monitor Macro (4)

; Manually disable keepout to jog inside for maintenance
M960 P0
```
